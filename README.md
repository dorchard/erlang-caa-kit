# erlang-caa-kit

## Overview

This project contains a number of prototype tools for working with the Communicating Actor Automata model of Erlang programs as described
in the paper [Communicating Actor Automata -- Modelling Erlang Processes as Communicating Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06395) by Orchard, Munteanu,
and Torrens.

The aim of this work is to provide a starting point for future tools
that could be used to leverage the CAA model for formal program development
of Erlang code.

## Status and Contributing

This code is experimental, and largely not in active development as of 2023.

We would gratefully accept contributions.
If you would like to contribute, please get in touch, or fork and make a PR.

A good starting projet would be to produce a command line interface for
this tool, packaging it so it is more easily deployed.

## Requirements and Environment

The code requires Erlang/OTP and has been tested with OTP25.

If you would like to generate visualisations then GraphViz is recommended,
although it is not necessary to generate models and generate code from
models.

If you would like to generate code, then you also need the [forms](https://github.com/efcasado/forms) module. The easiest approcach is to clone the repository and copy the `forms.erl` module here, e.g.
in this directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/efcasado/forms
cp forms/src/forms.erl .
```

##Â Using erlang-caa-kit

At the moment, `erlang-caa-kit` is driven from the `eshell` (Erlang Shell) via the command line, with two main components exemplified below.

### Model generation and visualisation


Start in the Erlang shell `erl`, then compile the relevant modules:

```
c(type).
c(method_Form).
c(generate_visualisation).
c(generate_model).
```

The core functionality is then via the
 `main` method which takes three inputs: the name of the file to
analyse, the name of function to analyse (including its arity
in Erlang's style of `functionName/arity`), and lastly a string prefix to give
to filenames for the visualisations generated along with the model.

For example, consider the `e` function in `testing_files/examples.erl`, which
has the code:

```
e(S) ->
    receive
        {get, P} -> P!S, e(S);
        {put, X} -> e(X)
end.
```

We can generate a model from this code by running:

```
Model = generate_model:main("testing_files/examples.erl", "e/1", "example").
```

This performs static analysis of the following code
outputting the Erlang representation of the CAA model:

```
{0,
 [{0,{recv,[{tuple,7,[{atom,7,get},{var,7,'P'}]}]},2},
  {2,{send,{var,7,'P'},{var,7,'S'}},0},
  {0,{recv,[{tuple,8,[{atom,8,put},{var,8,'X'}]}]},0}]}
```

This also generates three files:
- `exampleautomata.txt` - The above Erlang representation saved in text format;
- `examplegraph.dot` - The DOT file for the automata;
- `exampleCAA.pdf` - A PDF rendering of the DOT file (assuming GraphViz is installed).

For example, `exampleCAA.pdf` here give us the visualisation of this
function's CAA model:

![Example CAA](exampleCAA.png)

### Code generation

Continuing from the previous example, we bound the result of generating the model
to `Model`. Now we can import the code generation module and convert the model
back to Erlang code.

Code generation requires the [forms](https://github.com/efcasado/forms) module
(see the instructions on requirements above).


```
c(forms).
c(generate_code).
generate_code:main([Model]).
```

which outputs:

```
-export([f0/0]).
f2(P, S) ->
    P ! S,
    f0(P, S),
    ok.
f0(P, S) ->
    receive
        {get, P} -> f2(P, S);
        {put, X} -> f0(P, S)
    end,
    ok.

[]
```

We can see how the code generator has split this into multiple functions, but the code is extensionally equivalent to original function `e` (since the original only involve sending and receiving anyway).

## Testing

Tests for model generation can be run as follows:

```
c(type).
c(method_Form).
c(generate_visualisation).
c(generate_model).
c(test).
test:test().
```

It is known that many of these fail at the moment. This repo is still work in progress
and there was some bitrot from the original project that produced this work.
